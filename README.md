#  Hangman Game â€” React App

A simple yet fun Hangman word guessing game built using React.

This project was completed as part of the Full Stack Web Development course to demonstrate my ability to build a React app, manage component state, handle keyboard input, and deploy the app to production.



##  Features

- Random word selection from a word list
- Real-time tracking of correct and incorrect guesses
- Visual hangman image progression based on mistakes
- Modal popup for win/loss messages
- Responsive keyboard input handling
- Help modal for game instructions



##  Live Demo

You can play the deployed game here:

(Replace this with your actual deployed link)


##  Technologies Used

- React (Functional Components)
- useState and useEffect hooks
- JSX and conditional rendering
- CSS for styling
- Netlify for deployment


##  How to Play

1. The app selects a random word.
2. You guess one letter at a time using the keyboard or the on-screen keyboard.
3. Each incorrect guess shows a new part of the hangman image.
4. You win if you guess the word before the hangman is complete!
